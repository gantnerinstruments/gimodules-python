Various functionalities that are needed in different Jupyter Notebooks scripts are sourced out in 'modules' which act like a libraries.

The goal should be to seperate application-logic from domain-logic and enhance reusability.

.. important::

    A concrete Structure and module design is still to be determined (**TBD**).
